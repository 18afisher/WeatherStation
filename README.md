# WeatherStation
A weather station that uses a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino 101. This project uses the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol to transmit data. 
The Arduino 101 acts as a Peripheral device, allowing it to send data to a Central device.
The Raspberry Pi acts as a Central device, receiving data from the Peripheral (Arduino 101) and notifying it that it has received the data. 

# Version 0.1 
The first version! The program has some basic features, such as:
* Sending and retrieving data from an Arduino 101 to a Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
* Displaying data on 3 graphs

# What's coming next? 
Version 0.2 will have:
* A basic neural network
* A better graphical interface
